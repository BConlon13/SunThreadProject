    <section class="intro-text">
      <p class="large-text">This project emerges from an urgent need to make technology and environmental harmony tangible and embodied. In an era where the fight to combat climate change often feels abstract, distant and even impossible, SunThread creates an immediate connection between the wearer and solar energy systems.</p>
      <p class="large-text">The garment functions as both protective layer and energy harvester, embodying the solarpunk vision of technology that enhances rather than exploits our relationship with nature. By wearing SunThread, individuals become walking demonstrations of renewable energy potential, their bodies serving as platforms for sustainable technology integration.</p>

    <section class="intro-text">
      <p class="large-text">SunThread ultimately proposes clothing as an environmental interface and a medium through which we can experience and respond to the energy systems that sustain life on Earth. By making solar energy collection beautiful, responsive, and personally meaningful, the project offers a vision of how sustainable technology might be integrated into daily life.</p>

      <p class="large-text">In a world facing a climate crisis, SunThread suggests that our clothing itself might become part of the renewable energy solution, transforming every person into a walking solar collector and environmental advocate. The garment embodies the solarpunk promise that sustainability and beauty, technology and nature, can indeed coexist and thrive together.</p>
