    <h2>How It Will Be Made</h2>
    <p>​​The creation of SunThread begins with designing the garment, focusing on blending aesthetics with functionality. I started by researching solarpunk aesthetics to align with the theme of nature and sustainability. Next, I researched solar panels and the necessary tech components for generating power. The base garment, whether a vest or shoulder cape, will be crafted to seamlessly integrate soft electronics like LEDs and, potentially, sensors.</p>
      <p>The next steps include testing various types of solar panels and prototyping the electronics using an Arduino to manage the solar charging system. The biggest challenge will be balancing power efficiency while maintaining responsive interactions, ensuring the piece is both functional and wearable. Afterward, I will focus on carefully placing the electronic components within the garment to keep it safe to wear and prevent damage. The final steps will involve completing the wearable and documenting the results through photography and video.</p>
    <h2>Timeline</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Week 6:</strong> Test the solar panel setup. Experiment with LED and motor behavior. Work on designing the layout for the electronic system.</li>
      <li><strong>Week 7:</strong> Test solar panels and charging system on a breadboard. Refine electronics to ensure all components work in sync.</li>
      <li><strong>Week 8:</strong> Finalize the electronic system design. Address power consumption challenges and optimize circuit efficiency</li>
      <li><strong>Week 9:</strong> Finalize and assemble the electronic system. Design and construct garment elements to house the electronics. Continue testing environmental responsiveness (ex: light-based reactions).</li>
      <li><strong>Week 10:</strong> [Current Week] Complete integration of electronics into the garment base. Begin designing the full wearable and finalize how the tech will be embedded. Issue encountered: charger module and booster module failures require replacement and system redesign.</li>
      <li><strong>Interim Period (June 7-30):</strong>Source replacement components for failed charger and booster modules. Gather and test fabric materials for feasibility. Acquire garment patterns and finalize textile choices. Conduct material compatibility tests with electronic components.</li> 
      <li><strong>Week 11:</strong> Rebuild electronic system with new charger and booster modules. Test revised circuit functionality. Begin garment construction with selected materials and patterns.</li>
      <li><strong>Week 12: </strong>Sew full garment prototype and integrate electronics. Test system responsiveness and troubleshoot any power or interaction issues.</li>
      <li><strong>Week 13:</strong> Refine garment design based on testing feedback. Optimize electronic integration and explore additional responsive features.
      <li><strong>Week 14:</strong> Finalize the wearable system. Begin documentation using models (photo and video). Ensure full functionality and polish integration details.</li>
      <li><strong>Week 15:</strong> Complete final adjustments and fixes. Finalize video and photo documentation. Prepare everything for final presentation and display.</li>
