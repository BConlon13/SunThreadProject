    <h2>How It Will Be Made</h2>
    <p>​​The creation of SunThread begins with designing the garment, focusing on blending aesthetics with functionality. I started by researching solarpunk aesthetics to align with the theme of nature and sustainability. Next, I researched solar panels and the necessary tech components for generating power. The base garment, whether a vest or shoulder cape, will be crafted to seamlessly integrate soft electronics like LEDs and, potentially, motors.</p>
      <p>The next steps include testing various types of solar panels and prototyping the electronics using an Arduino to manage the solar charging system. The biggest challenge will be balancing power efficiency while maintaining responsive interactions, ensuring the piece is both functional and wearable. Afterward, I will focus on carefully placing the electronic components within the garment to keep it safe to wear and prevent damage. The final steps will involve completing the wearable and documenting the results through photography and video.</p>
    <h2>Timeline</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Week 6:</strong> Test the solar panel setup. Experiment with LED and motor behavior. Work on designing the layout for the electronic system.</li>
      <li><strong>Week 7:</strong> Test solar panels and charging system on a breadboard. Refine electronics to ensure all components work in sync.</li>
      <li><strong>Week 8:</strong> Finalize the electronic system design. Address power consumption challenges and optimize circuit efficiency</li>
      <li><strong>Week 9:</strong> Finalize and assemble the electronic system. Design and construct garment elements to house the electronics. Continue testing environmental responsiveness (ex: light-based reactions).</li>
      <li><strong>Week 10:</strong> Complete integration of electronics into the garment base. Begin designing the full wearable and finalize how the tech will be embedded. Troubleshoot any issues with power or interaction systems.</li>
      <li><strong>Week 11:</strong> Sew a full garment prototype and test its responsiveness. Improve design based on testing feedback. Explore potential new design features or motion-responsive elements. </li>
      <li><strong>Week 12-13: </strong>Focus on completing all wearable pieces. Ensure full functionality and polish integration details.</li>
      <li><strong>Week 14:</strong> Finalize the wearables. Begin documentation using models (photo and video). Refine and troubleshoot for presentation readiness. </li>
      <li><strong>Week 15:</strong> Make any final adjustments or fixes. Complete final video and photo documentation. Prepare everything for final presentation and display. </li>
    </ul>
