    <h2>Week 5 Update</h2>
    <p>This week, I tested some used solar panels I found, hoping they would work for the project. Unfortunately, despite my best efforts, they didn't produce any output at all. I initially thought I might be doing something wrong, but after troubleshooting, I realized the panels were just not functional. Not to worry, though. I've already ordered new mini solar panels, along with LEDs and batteries, which should arrive soon. I'll be testing these components in Week 6.</p>

    <p>If I can move quickly with the testing, I also have motors ready to experiment with for adding movement to the garment. My goal is to integrate some dynamic motion features, but I'll hold off on this step until I can be sure the power system is stable and working well. I don't want to overcomplicate things if the solar panels and electronics take longer than expected to get set up.</p>

    <h2>Week 10 Update</h2>
    <p>This week presented significant challenges that have impacted my project timeline, though I've gained valuable insights that will inform my approach moving forward.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Component Testing and Challenges:</strong> Testing various component configurations has progressed more slowly than anticipated due to multiple hardware failures. Several components proved defective upon arrival, and replacement parts also failed, creating unexpected delays and requiring additional troubleshooting time.</p>

    <p><strong>LED System Performance:</strong> The LED components function properly, but battery capacity limitations required scaling down the system to approximately 8 LEDs per circuit to prevent overheating and ensure stable power draw.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Charger Module Issues:</strong> The charger module presented the most significant setback, failing to establish any connection. Multiple replacement attempts yielded defective units, consuming considerable time and resources. Through consultation with advisors, I learned that prioritizing component quality over cost efficiency is critical for charging systems, as reliability is paramount for project success.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Boost Module Complications:</strong> While the boost modules function, they operate with limitations. Configuring the boards to 5V output requires desoldering components, a process that has resulted in three board failures. Given that the final wearable will require multiple 8-LED systems, additional modules will be necessary to complete the project.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Successful Components:</strong> Solar panel performance has exceeded expectations. I've expanded my inventory to 45 panels total, with plans to implement 8-10 panels per garment section based on sun exposure optimization (lower garment areas requiring higher panel density than areas like sleeves).</p>

    <p><strong>Strategic Solutions:</strong></p>
    <p><em>Financial Management:</em> I've secured a creative grant through my lab workspace, providing funding for quality components. This addresses the cost-efficiency versus reliability balance identified through recent component failures.</p>
    
    <p><em>Timeline Recovery:</em> Despite setbacks, I've established a verified working system architecture. The interim period between academic terms will be utilized for material sourcing and compatibility testing, allowing me to maintain the weeks 11-15 timeline.</p>
    
    <p><em>Resource Access:</em> I've secured access to soldering equipment and industrial sewing machines at two summer session locations, ensuring adequate workspace and tools for advanced fabrication requirements.</p>
    
    <p>This week's challenges have provided crucial learning experiences about component selection and project management, positioning the project for more efficient progress in subsequent phases.</p>
