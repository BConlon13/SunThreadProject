    <h2>Week 5 Update</h2>
    <p>This week, I tested some used solar panels I found, hoping they would work for the project. Unfortunately, despite my best efforts, they didn't produce any output at all. I initially thought I might be doing something wrong, but after troubleshooting, I realized the panels were just not functional. Not to worry, though. I’ve already ordered new mini solar panels, along with LEDs and batteries, which should arrive soon. I'll be testing these components in Week 6.</p>

    <p>If I can move quickly with the testing, I also have motors ready to experiment with for adding movement to the garment. My goal is to integrate some dynamic motion features, but I’ll hold off on this step until I can be sure the power system is stable and working well. I don’t want to overcomplicate things if the solar panels and electronics take longer than expected to get set up.</p>
    <p>The images above are AI generated artwork that look similar to the ideas I have in mind for the finished garment. I used OpenArt.</p>

    <h2>Final Work</h2>
    <p>Coming July 2025</p>
